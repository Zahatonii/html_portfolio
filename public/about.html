<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Zahid, but most people call me Zaha.</p>

<p>
  I am a passionate web designer and web developer who creates clean, modern,
  and user-focused websites for small and medium businesses.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy turning ideas into beautiful and functional websites that not only
  look great but also deliver a smooth user experience. Every project is an
  opportunity for me to combine creativity with code and build something unique
  and meaningful.
</p>

<p>
  I started my journey in web design and development in 2024, and since then I
  have been continuously learning and growing with every project. With an eye
  for detail and love for aesthetics, I make sure every pixel and every line of
  code counts.
</p>

<p>
  When I am not designing or coding, you will probably find me watching
  Euroleague basketball, solving quizzes, or reading some book.
</p>

<p>LetÂ´s build something great together!</p>
